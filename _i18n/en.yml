  uvp: Learn one topic every month
  description: Hello, I'm Sandoche. In 2017, I decided to start the <strong>Learning Lab challenge</strong>.<br>The goal of this project is to learn about <strong>one topic every month</strong> and to <strong>build projects</strong> out of it. Why? Because <strong>it makes me happy</strong> and I invite you to do the same!
